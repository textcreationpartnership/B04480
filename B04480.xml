            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <p>And BE IT ENACTED by the Kings moſt excellent Majeſty by &amp; with the Advice and Conſent of this preſent General Aſſembly and the Authority of the ſame, that if any Man or his Aſſigns hold a tract of Land lying in the woods, and from his firſt or other markt tree or end of the line, or otherwiſe run a certain courſe &amp; certain number of perches to a Bay River Creek Branch or Beaver damm which have a conſtant Sream or certain Bed of a Channel if the courſe directs thereto and the number of perches fall ſhort thereof, in ſuch and the like caſes, if adding fifty <hi>per cent.</hi> thereto will reach the ſaid Bay River, Creek, Branch or Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver damm expreſt in the ſaid grant, the ſaid line ſhall be extended thereto, as in other caſes hereafter, being certain natural and unalterable bounds.</p>

               <p>And if the ſaid markt tree be attained by adding of fifty <hi>per cent.</hi> to every hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred perches of the ſaid line which leads to it, the owner of ſuch Land ſhall hold

               <p>And if any Man hold a Tract of Land by the ſide of a Creek, River or Branch and it be deſcribed to begin at a markt tree by the ſide of the ſaid Creek River or Branch, and at the laſt is on that ſide to be bounded with the ſaid Creek, River or Branch, but it is expreſt from the ſaid markt tree to run up or down the ſaid creek river or branch a certain number of perches or a certain courſe, which declines from the water ſide and runs into the Land and no markt Tree appointed for it to end at, in all ſuch like caſes the owners of the ſaid Land ſhall reverſe his laſt line, <hi>viz.</hi> as ſuppoſe the firſt courſe is North one hundred perches to the branch creek or river and the other Weſt one hundred and ſixty perches and then South one hundred perches, and then Eaſt, or on a ſtreight line to the firſt markt tree, he ſhall run from his firſt tree Weſt one hundred and ſixty peches, &amp; then South one hundred perches, and then Eaſt unto the ſaid creek river or branch, and where the ſaid Eaſt line interſects or falls into the water it ſhall determin his bounds, &amp; he ſhall hold from that interſection by the water ſide to the firſt tree, but in this caſe or any caſes parallel, if fifty <hi>per cent.</hi> will not interſect the branch, creek or river, then the preciſe lines and courſe to be the bounds thereof, &amp; the reverſing of lines ſhall determin bounds, when the lines by the water fide ſlants over the creek, river or branch, &amp; in that caſe the creek river or branch ſhall be the bounds of ſuch tract, and it ſhall not paſs over as in the ſecond third and fourth example is demonſtrated and the reaſon why fifty <hi>pir cent.</hi> is allowed to reach the creek, river or branch, that if more is there will be no coherence between the creek and the courſe.</p>
               <p>And if a Tract be diſcribed to lie on a certain ſide of a creek river or branch, &amp; begin at a markt tree, and run a certain courſe, as ſuppoſe North one hundred per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches up or down the ſaid creek or river to another markt tree by the river ſide, which ſecond markt tree is known and really ſtands by the water ſide; and make the breadth of the Land within fifty <hi>per cent',</hi> there the ſecond line ſuppoſing eaſt ſhall be drawn from the ſecond tree the certain number of perches, ſuppoſing one

               <p>And if a tract of land be laid out for a certain number of Acres on ſuch courſes, which tho' the length of the lines yet the acuteneſs of the Angles will not make the certain number of Acres, yet the tract ſhall be confined by ſuch bounds, as ſuppoſing the firſt line be north fifty perches, &amp; then north eaſt or north north eaſt or the like eighty perches, and ſo parallel, and yet the owner ſhall be contented, &amp; all latter Surveys adjoyning to ſuch lines ſhall be good as in the ſeaventh example.</p>
               <p>And if any Man have a greater number of perches given him in length or in breadth by expreſs words, then he ought to have, yet he ſhall hold the ſame a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt any latter taker up, and againſt the Lord Proprietor rendring Rent, as ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe north fifty perches, then eaſt eighty perches, and ſo lines parallel for one hundred Acres as in the eighth example.</p>
               <p>Every Man that hath an Iſland intirely granted to him, altho' he have Surpluſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age ſhall hold the ſame altho' lines or courſes or number of perches be not rightly expreſt to conclude the ſame againſt any latter taker up, &amp; againſt the Lord Propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etor rendring Rent, if his Lordſhip ſhall for diſcovery of ſuch Rent cauſe the ſame to be reſurveyed, and his Lordſhip his Heirs or Succeſſors ſhall not for any Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pluſage intirely damn or confound any Pattent upon pretence of being deceived in his grant or any other pretence, becauſe every Man had land granted him in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration that by performing conditions of Plantations it was due to him, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept where his Lordſhip hath granted any Lands <hi>ex mero motu de gratiae ſpecialia</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And whereas by this Act it is provided that if any Man hold fifty <hi>per cent.</hi> above his number of perches betwixt his known bounds he ſhall maintain the ſame a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt any latter taker up <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and will not reſurvey his land in due time, but that the Lord Proprietor grant the Svrpluſage to another, yet if the firſt taker up have ſeated his Plantation and made his improvement after the certain number of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches is determined, yet the Surpluſage ſhall not be ſaid to be there only after ſuch determination of ſuch number of perches, hecauſe after the Surveyor hath once by deſcription as it were ſhapt the land it is then all granted at once <hi>uno flatu,</hi> &amp; the Surpluſage ſhall be aſſigned by a Jury intirely to lie together, but to the leaſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment of the firſt Grantee.</p>
               <p>And if a certain number of perches in any caſe be preſcribed to run by a Creek, River or Branch ſide, and no markt tree nor certain courſe expreſt, the ſaid num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of perches ſhall not be ſpent away by the ſeveral windings of the River Creek or Cove but brought to a ſtreight line of that length, or elſe be regulated by the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther courſes as in other caſes is provided.</p>
               <p>If Land be bounded by a Creek or Cove running a certain courſe or number of perches, as ſuppoſe north one hundred perches, if that branch creek or cove were out and expire, or unreaſonably wind above five points from the courſe into the land before the number of perches be determined, ſo that there be no certain run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Stream or certain Bed or Channel of a Stream continuing to the end of the line, or if there be ſuch windings as aforeſaid, in ſuch caſes the lines ſhall be the bounds from the beginning to ending; provided that all the adjacent lands be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the creek and the line before it comes to ſlant over the branch creek or cove ſhall be added and taken to be part of the Land, that is ſo far as the creek includes as in the ninth example.</p>
               <p>If Land begin at a markt tree by a River, Creek, Branch or Cove, and ſo go up or down the ſaid River, Creek, Branch or Cove to another markt tree at the mouth
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:174994:35"/>of a Creek or Cove, and then be preſcribed to run a certain courſe or number of perches by the ſaid creek or cove, and the ſpending away of the number of perch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es upon the winding of the ſaid creek or cove would ſhorten the line from extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing far enough into the woods, and the creek winde outward from the land, and varying from the courſe, in this caſe the full line and courſe preſcribed ſhall be run out, and from the end of that line ſhall be drawn a line revent to the next courſe which is to be run till the line reverſe interſect the ſaid creek or cove, and by that interſection it ſhall be deſcribed kow far that tract ſhall be bounded by the creek <hi>&amp;c</hi> and the reſt of the bounds ſkall in ſuch caſe be aſcertained by the fourth example, as ſuppoſe from the ſecond tree at the mouth of a cove <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the line pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed Eaſt one hundred and ſixty perches by the cove and bounded by the cove, and the ſaid creek winds away Eaſt North Eaſt, the eaſt line of the one hundred and ſixty perches ſhall be run out, and if from the end of the eaſt line the courſe ſhould be ſouth, then there ſhall firſt be drawn a line northe to the cove, &amp; that north line ſhall deſcribe at the place where it interfects the cove how far that tract ſhall be bounded by the cove, and then at the interſection the ſouth line ſhall be begun and continued till it interſects a line drawn eaſt to the firſt tree as in the fourth example aforeſaid, always provided the ſouth line be not fifty <hi>per cent.</hi> more than it ought to be, but if the ſouth line be fifty <hi>per cent.</hi> than it ought to be then the ſouth line ſhall be the bounds and not the creek or cove, and if the ſouth line go to the weſtward of the firſt tree, then the eaſt line aforeſaid ſhall be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther extended that the ſouth line may at leaſt come to the beginning tree.</p>
               <p>In all caſes where poſitive eye witneſs cannot be had, there traditional widence <hi>viva voce</hi> concurring with and agreeable to Record ſhall be accounted good proof declaring from whom they had their tradition, and not affirming any markt tree or bounds other then or differing from what is expreſt on Record, and where the firſt markt tree is wanting, and the beginning cannot be reaſonably proved, but yet a ſecond or third markt tree is found, the tree ſo found ſhall rule the bounds of the whole tract, according to the rules of this Act mentioned, or hereafter to be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, where a Man holds a Penninſula or Neck of Land and have ſeveral markt or lined trees upon the points or capes of his tract which do not very exactly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree in courſe or diſtance, and yet by good evidence prove his exteriour bounds, and the whole neck as 'tis commonly called or Penninſula be granted to him, there all things ſhall be favourably interpreted, to his holding the whol neck 'gainſt any later taker up alrho' he hath built &amp; improv'd, becauſe tis unreaſonable a 2 <abbr>
